$ terraform init

Initializing Terraform Cloud...

The local Terraform version (1.6.3-dev) is not available in Terraform Cloud, or your
organization does not have access to it. The new workspace will use 1.6.3. You can
change this later in the workspace settings.

Initializing provider plugins...
- Finding hashicorp/random versions matching "3.4.3"...
- Finding hashicorp/aws versions matching "4.52.0"...
- Installing hashicorp/random v3.4.3...
- Installed hashicorp/random v3.4.3 (signed by HashiCorp)
- Installing hashicorp/aws v4.52.0...
- Installed hashicorp/aws v4.52.0 (signed by HashiCorp)

Terraform has created a lock file .terraform.lock.hcl to record the provider
selections it made above. Include this file in your version control repository
so that Terraform can guarantee to make the same selections by default when
you run "terraform init" in the future.

Terraform Cloud has been successfully initialized!

You may now begin working with Terraform Cloud. Try running "terraform plan" to
see any changes that are required for your infrastructure.

If you ever set or change modules or Terraform Settings, run "terraform init"
again to reinitialize your working directory.


$ terraform plan
